# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to C4. It's people like you that make C4 great. This guide's purpose is to keep eveyone on the same page as to what we look for when evaluating contributions.

We are looking for contributions in regards to bug reports, bug fixing, documentation improvements, example code and new features. Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Instead visit our [Slack channel](https://join-c4.herokuapp.com/) or try asking in StackOverflow.

# Ground Rules

* Test all code changes. This includes running the unit tests on all platforms and writing new unit tests when necessary. To run the tests in Xcode click on Product -> Test.
* Ensure that your code follows the same style as the rest of the code. Please use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for this.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
